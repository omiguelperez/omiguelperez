### Hi!! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Oscar PÃ©rez

I'm Backend Engineer with experience in Software Development using Python with Django and Node.js. I have a lot of experience in backend development implementing unit and integration testing, software architectures, design patterns and best practices. I also have experience with Vue.js, AWS services, Docker containers, IT automation with Ansible and SCRUM methodology.

In my thesis, I evaluated Behavior-Driven Development in a Colombian Software Factory and develop a private C# tool with .NET Core support to automatize Gherkin Specifications for UI Testing with Selenium.

Ask me about Node.js or Python/Django.
